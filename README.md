# Autonomous Landing of Quadcopter on a Floating Platform using ROS, Gazebo and Python
This is my master's project. 

This is a complete simulation based work. Imagine there is a floating platform on an ocean and we would want a quadcopter to land on it.
Well this is what this project solves. I used ROS, Gazebo and Python. For automation landing task, I use camera mounted on the quadcopter along with Computer Vision techniques to detect the platform along with various different orientations.
I used a PID controller to make the quadcopter land on the platform.


Here is a demo on how it works when the platform moves and the quadcopter needs to land on it.
